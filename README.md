# 📊 Scientometric Time Series Forecasting  
### Large-Scale Forecasting of Brazilian Scientific Production Using LSTM and Nonlinear Regression

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project implements a complete **time-series forecasting pipeline** to model and predict long-term trends in Brazilian scientific production using real-world large-scale academic data.

The system compares classical nonlinear regression with deep learning (LSTM) to evaluate performance under structural changes and volatility regimes.

The forecasting framework developed here is directly transferable to:

- Demand forecasting  
- Product growth modeling  
- KPI trend prediction  
- Revenue forecasting  
- User activity modeling

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Scientific production evolves under the influence of:

- Public funding policies  
- Institutional strategy  
- Economic cycles  
- Global disruptions  

This project models and forecasts:

- 📄 Journal publications  
- 🔬 Research projects  
- 🎓 Academic advisories  

Across the 8 major CAPES knowledge areas in Brazil.

The goal is to:

- Model historical growth and decline patterns  
- Compare baseline and deep learning models  
- Quantitatively evaluate predictive robustness  
- Extract structural insights from national scientometric data
